`VOLI`, pronounced "volley", is a simple, todo-list-game developed as a vehicle to (find / develop / test / establish) a human-readable, plain-text, aesthetically-acceptable (data / table)-format codenamed `Omni`.  We want `Omni` to be the "`Markdown`" of data.
```
Markdown :: Text
    Omni :: Data
```

## Motivation
- The large amount of inter-related datasets produced by playing `VOLI` should provide fertile ground for establishing a pleasing to (use / read) table-format.
- This project is also meant to get the team to up to speed on using all features of `git`, and `GitHub`

## `Omni`-Format: Initial Specification Roster
- Human-readable (e.g. similar to `Markdown`)
- 2D, tabular representation of complex, hierarchical data structures
- (!!!) Capable of handling aliases for any data entry (notably including object-keys)
- Establish some sample of Permanent (ID / location) assignment
